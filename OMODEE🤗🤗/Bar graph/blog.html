    <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>In this blog post, we will delve into the fascinating world of pharmacokinetics by
            analyzing the Tetracycline1 dataset. Tetracycline is a commonly prescribed antibiotic
            that has been widely used for several decades. By exploring this dataset, we will gain 
            nsights into the pharmacokinetic properties of tetracycline, including its absorption,
            distribution, metabolism, and elimination. Through data analysis and visualizations, 
            we will unravel the behavior of this important antibiotic within the body.
        </p>

    <h1>Graphs</h1>
    Sourcing the Dataset:
For this analysis, we will utilize the Tetracycline1 dataset, which contains information 
about the pharmacokinetics of tetracycline in different individuals. The dataset can be o
btained from [source name] or [link to dataset].

<h2>Question 1</h2> 
<p>What is the absorption profile of tetracycline?
    To understand how tetracycline is absorbed into the body, we will analyze the data related 
    to its concentration in the bloodstream over time. By visualizing the absorption profile, we can 
    determine how quickly the antibiotic enters the systemic circulation after administration.

        <h2>Question 2</h2>
        <p>How is tetracycline eliminated from the body?
        To gain insights into the elimination of tetracycline, we will examine the data 
        related to its concentration decline over time. By visualizing the elimination 
        profile, we can understand the drug's half-life and the rate at which it is cleared
         from the body.
